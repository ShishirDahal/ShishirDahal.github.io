                <p> At DEW Academy we believe every child deserves to feel safe, secure, respected, loved and cared for. 
                We believe all children are unique, therefore we support their independence by working with their families 
                to develop the skills needed to be successful in life. We demonstrate and teach tolerance, acceptance and inclusion of children and families with 
                different abilities, inabilities, cultures, and economic status. 
                </p>
                <br />
                
                <p> In our program we work on the child's development through play. Our child-centered activities/curriculum inspires the children to learn and discover through play 
                to spark their own natural curiosity. We work with children according to their interest, help them in developing their own ideas and assist them 
                so that they get freedom to choose their activities. This promotes a sense of independence, self-direction and enthusiasm for participation in children. 
                </p>
                <br />

               <p>Our priority is to develop appropriate programs that allow your child to explore his or her world in a safe, caring environment while developing his or her 
                   own individual interests and abilities. We balance teacher-directed activities with child-directed activities in order to maximize those benefits.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>   With our years of expertise and experience, we have developed a creative curriculum that combines most of the well-regarded Montessori principles, 
                and Reggio Emilia curriculum in the field of early childhood education and development.
